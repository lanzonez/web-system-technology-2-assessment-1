        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <h2>Key Points</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Section 1."An Act Establishing a Comprehensive Juvenile Justice and Welfare System, Creating the Juvenile justice and Welfare Council under the Department of Social Welfare and Development, Appropriating Funds Therefor, and for Other Purposes."</li>
           
            <li>Section 2. "SEC. 6. Minimum Age of Criminal Responsibility. – A child fifteen (15) years of age or under at the time of the commission of the offense shall be exempt from criminal liability. However, the child shall be subjected to an intervention program pursuant to Section 20 of this Act.

"A child is deemed to be fifteen (15) years of age on the day of the fifteenth anniversary of his/her birthdate.

"A child above fifteen (15) years but below eighteen (18) years of age shall likewise be exempt from criminal liability and be subjected to an intervention program, unless he/she has acted with discernment, in which case, such child shall be subjected to the appropriate proceedings in accordance with this Act.

"The exemption from criminal liability herein established does not include exemption from civil liability, which shall be enforced in accordance with existing laws."

</li>
          
            <li>Section 3. Liberal Construction of this Act – In case of doubt, the interpretation of any of the provisions of this Act, including its implementing rules and regulations (IRRs), shall be construed liberally in favor of the child in conflict with the law.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Implementation</h2>
        <p>Republic Act 10630, signed into law in 2013 in the Philippines, primarily aims to strengthen the Commission on Audit (COA) and enhance its institutional capacity. The COA is tasked with auditing government agencies to ensure transparency and accountability in the use of public funds.

The JJWC shall promulgate the necessary rules and regulations within sixty (60) days from the effectivity of this Act.

This law has positive effects across sectors as it promotes good governance, fiscal responsibility, and effective resource utilization. The increased transparency benefits areas like education, healthcare, infrastructure, and social services, ensuring funds are allocated efficiently to address the country's needs.</p>
